            <p>Spring is coming, and it's time for the annual toothpick bridge competition. Don't watch your bridges collapse! Instead come to Maxwell Scientific for high-quality materials and adhesives. Maxwell Scientific also provides educational material to teach basic engineering principles and help your students design the best structures. When it comes time to put those bridges to the test, look towards Maxwell Scientific for precision structure testers.</p>
